# Friend Finder

A Shrek-themed FriendFinder.

## Where I Went Right

The server works. You can navigate around using the routes.

## Where I Went Wrong

No clue how to do the comparison between the api and the survey results. The insturctions were a little confusing and I didn't know how to even pull up the lowest difference between answer arrays.

I know I needed an API route and I need to send the info from the survey over to that api for comparison. Or maybe vice versa on that...? Again, this is why we're at this point. I'm lost. 


## Deployment

Deployed to Heroku.

Here it is: [FriendFinder]()
